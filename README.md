# TheKanbanboard
Kanban is a work management method that originated from the Toyota Production System for lean production. The main purpose of this method is to minimize activities that lead to losses without affecting productivity.
The kanban board has three columns 
•	Requested
•	In Progress
•	Completed
If properly set up and used, the board serves as an information hub that shows where the bottlenecks are and what hampers the smooth flow of the workflow.
By following Kanban principle and practice one can achieve maximum output with minimum losses. 
So, our idea was to bring the concept of Kanban to common people who can use Kanban and achieve more in there day today life.
